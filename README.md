AI Media Detector
Overview

AI-generated content is increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic media. This project implements a hybrid AI detection system that analyzes text, images, and video to estimate whether content was generated by artificial intelligence.

The system combines transformer-based models, heuristic analysis, and multimodal reasoning to produce explainable, probabilistic results. A Flask web interface allows users to submit media and view detection outcomes.

This project was developed for a Social and Professional Issues in Computing course and focuses on ethical concerns related to misinformation, deepfakes, and trust in digital media.

Features

Text detection using RoBERTa, heuristic metrics, and Gemini reasoning

Image detection using CLIP and Gemini multimodal analysis

Video detection via frame extraction and aggregated image analysis

Flask web interface with confidence visualization

Technical Approach

The detector uses a hybrid architecture:

Transformers (RoBERTa, CLIP) identify statistical patterns common in AI-generated media

Heuristic metrics provide transparent, explainable indicators

Gemini evaluates semantic and visual realism

Combining multiple models improves reliability compared to a single detector.

Running the Project

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Set the Gemini API key:

export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"


Run the Flask app:

python app.py


Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a browser.

Limitations

Detection results are probabilistic and not definitive. AI-generated content may evade detection, and human-created content may appear AI-like.
